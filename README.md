# naive_bayes

Implemented naive bayes algorithm in python, to categorize 10,000 documents in 20 newsgroups with 75% accuracy.
Used 10,000 documents for training data and 10,000 documents for testing data.
Used a unique data structure of dictionary of lists of dictionaries to drastically improve its efficiency.
I've permanently stored the data in data.json, unique_words.json(This is the bag of words), and probaibilities.json for easy access.
Used laplace's formula for probability calculation.
